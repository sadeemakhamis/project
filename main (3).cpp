Kinetic Energy 
A car with a mass of 700 kg is moving with a speed of 20m/s. Calculate the kinetic energy of the car? 
Mass of the body m=700kg, 
Velocity v=20m/s, 
kinetic energy=140000 J




Newton’s second law:F=ma 
1- To find Force: 
What net force is required to accelerate a car at a rate of 2 m/s2 if the car has a mass of 3,000 kg?
m = 3000 kg
a = 2 m/s^2
F=6000N 



2-To find mass: 
What is the mass of a truck if it produces a force of 14,000 N while accelerating at a rate of 5 m/s2 ?
a = 5 m/s^2 
F=14,000N
m = 2800 kg 


3-To find acceleration: 
What is the acceleration ofsoftball if it has a mass of 0.5 kg and hits the catcher's glove with a force of 25 N?
m 0.5 kg
F=25N 
a = 50 m/s^2









momentum law P=mv 
calculate the momentum of a boat with a mass of 95 kg moving at 2 m/s?
mass m =95kg
velocity v = 2m/s 
momentum = 190kgm/s


Ideal gas law 
Determine the volume of occupied by 4.54 grams of carbon dioxide gas at STP. 
Solution: 
2- To find Volume: 
V = nRT / P 
n=0.1 T=273 P=1 
V = 2.240238 L


1- To find Pressure: 
4- 4.500 g of solid CO2 is put in an empty sealed 7.00 L container at a temperature of 273 K. When all the solid CO2 becomes gas, what will be the pressure in the container? 
Solution: 
P= nRT/V 
n = 0.10225 mol T=273
V=7 
P = 0.327234765 atm
3- To find mol: 
2- 96.0 g. of a gas occupies 48.0 L at 700.0 mm Hg and 20.0 °C. What is its molecular weight? 
Solution: 
n = PV / RT 
P=0.92 V= 48 T=293 
n = [(700.0 mmHg / 760.0 mmHg atm??1) (48.0 L)] / [(0.08206 L atm mol??1 K??1) (293.0 K)] 
n = 1.836664923 mol


4- To find Temperature: 
3- At what temperature will 0.789 moles of neon gas occupy 14.30 liters at 1.89 atmospheres? 
Solution: 
T = PV / nR 
P=1.89 V=14.30 n=0.789 
T = [(1.89 atm) (14.30 L)] / [(0.789 mol) (0.08206 L atm mol??1 K??1)] 
T = 417.4354479 K
